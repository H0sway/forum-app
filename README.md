# Forum App

### Technologies

This app was created using React on Rails and Webpack.

### Purpose

The purpose of this app was to create a place for users to discuss with other users online. There's no real focus of conversation. The provided topics cover a variety of possible discussions users could look to start or join in.

### MVP

1. Components listing each topic, all the posts inside of a topic, and all the comments to a post.
2. Users can create their own posts and comments.
3. Users can edit and delete their comments.

### Post MVP

1. Implement auth so that users can only edit and delete their own posts/comments (although they can still read and respond to other users' posts and comments).
2. Fully styled page in CSS.
3. Wider range of topics to post in.
